* i18n notes
Internationalization and localization.
I'm using _perl_ to work on these puzzles, so my notes will reflect that.

** Language
*** Basics
- utf8 option to the open pragma allows most magical IO in perl to use the utf8 read/write options...
- perldoc unitut, uniintro
- Encode

  
** Time
*** Basics
The builtin ~Time::~ do not seem to be of much use.
I am trying out the datetime module.
~DateTime~ for epoch calculation, and ~DateTime::Format::Strptime~ for parsing.
